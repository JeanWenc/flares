<b>You may fork the application from the present repository and run it locally on your computer. In order to do so please run the 'runFLARES.R' script from rStudio.</b></br>
<em>N.B. Before using FLARES you must create in the 'www' folder (located in the root directory) the following folder 'userDB' and place into it the following <a href="www.anthrocogs.com/res/users.csv">file</a>.</em>
