<i>Copyright (C) 2017 Jean Wenc√©lius - GNU Licence - AGPL v3</i>

FLARES is an open-source shiny (RStudio, 2014) application hosted on a server.
It has been developed to replace FLAME (http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/lesc/spip.php?article63) and to falicitate free-list analysis.

FLARES is hosted by a distant server and can be accessed at www.anthrocogs.com/shiny/flares.

<b>You may fork the application from the present repository and run it locally on your computer. In order to do so please run the 'runFLARES.R' script from rStudio.</b></br>
<em>N.B. Before using FLARES you must create in the 'www' folder (located in the root directory) the following folder 'userDB' and place into it the following file (www.anthrocogs.com/res/users.csv).</em>

The software is to be published in a peer-reviewed journal soon.
User guide and paper will soon be provided and uploaded to this repository.
